# Agentic Design Patterns - A. Gulli - Chapter 02: Routing Examples

This directory contains suggested code examples for Chapter 02 ("Routing") of the "Agentic Design Patterns" book.

Chapter 02 explores various approaches to implementing routing in agentic systems, enabling dynamic decision-making and flexible workflows based on user input or system state.

The examples demonstrate different routing mechanisms using popular frameworks:

- [`src/adk_routing.py`](src/adk_routing.py): Demonstrates LLM-driven delegation (Auto-Flow) using the Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK).
- [`src/langchain_routing.py`](src/langchain_routing.py): Illustrates state-based routing using LangGraph, a library built on LangChain.

These examples showcase how to implement conditional logic to direct the flow of control to different tools, agents, or processes within an agentic application.
